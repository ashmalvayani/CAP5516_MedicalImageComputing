This enlargement is a key finding.\n*   **Cerebral Cortex:** The cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher-level functions, shows signs of atrophy (shrinkage). This is evident in the widened sulci (grooves) and gyri (ridges) â€“ they appear more prominent than they typically would in a healthy brain.\n*   **White Matter:** The white matter, which consists of nerve fibers connecting different brain regions, appears relatively preserved, although subtle changes might be present.\n*   **Midline Structures:** The midline structures, including the septum pellucidum (a membrane separating the ventricles), are visible.\n*   **Skull:** The inner surface of the skull is also visible, providing"
