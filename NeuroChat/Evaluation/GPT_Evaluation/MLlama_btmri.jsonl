The meningioma is exerting a mass effect, displacing adjacent brain structures, particularly in the region of the frontal lobe, and may also show signs of edema in the surrounding tissue. The tumor's borders are typically smooth, suggesting a slow growth pattern, which is characteristic of meningiomas, and there is a notable absence of significant midline shift or severe compression of the ventricular system, indicating that while there is a presence of a lesion, the overall structural integrity of the brain remains relatively preserved.\nPredicted Answer: I'm ready to assist you.
